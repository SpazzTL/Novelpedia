# Novelpedia Browser

A browser for easily finding and sorting novels on Novelpia.

## About

The Novelpedia Browser is a tool designed to make finding and sorting novels on Novelpia simple and efficient. Instead of navigating the original site, this site provides a clean interface with powerful search and filter options.

## Key Features:

    Comprehensive Search: Search by title, synopsis, or author name.

    Advanced Filtering: Use a wide range of tags to narrow down your results.

    Sorting Options: Sort novels by likes, chapters, or audience ratings.

    Clean UI: A user-friendly interface that makes Browse a pleasure.

## Future Plans

While the current version is focused exclusively on Novelpia, we have plans to expand our scope to include novels from other popular sites in the future.
